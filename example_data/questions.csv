Does On use PFAS?;"By 2025 we are committed to phasing out the intentional use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl
substances (PFAS) in our supply chain. Our team has been working hard to ensure that
any materials we use that require durable water repellence are PFAS-free. \n\nIn 2023,
93% of our waterproof footwear and apparel volumes produced, were manufactured
without intentionally added PFAS. Our chemical management policy, which is guiding
this phase-out, is based on the AFIRM restricted substances list (RSL). AFIRM provides
industry-leading resources for apparel and footwear supply chains that are seeking to
increase product quality and safety and reduce their environmental impact by limiting the
use of certain substances. \n\nRead more about this in our <a
